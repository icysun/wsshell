## WebSocket Remote Shell

Wow, you can do a shell upload, how cool is that! And, the best way to enjoy the code execution is by gaining a shell from your computer. But, WAF, it sucks! It can't connect to the outside world. Here, it is, the solution!

## But your shell sucks, even more than the WAF, why don't use bind shell!

This is a really unique way to run a shell, that's what I want! Also, this shell has an encrypted connection, what can be better! Server admin can't know what did you do! (actually can). And feel free to get out from this project if you don't like it.

## How to play

- Upload the shell: *wsshell.py*
- Execute the shell: `$ ./wsshell.py`
- Done, use it at port 4242, by playing with wscat or websocat! Or, you can use this [awesome Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-websocket-client/pfdhoblngboilpfeibdedpjgfnlcodoo)
